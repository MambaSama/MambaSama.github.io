Not just how the world affects me, but also how I react and what I do in order to survive and be a part of our current society. I felt these would post as a statement not only for my own mind, body, and spirit, but also to relate to some others and bring out a reality they refuse to come to terms with.</p>

        <p style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: large; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(73, 73, 73);text-align: center;"> In my Mind pieces, something I focused on that I really wanted to impact my viewers, was the control that others have over what we think. The corruption of all the hands that put their own thoughts and rules into our minds including my own. However, our creative thoughts can drown those opinions and other people out and make ourselves our own person. Some people need to realise that our minds can save us from our realities. For my body piece, it correlates with meanings behind my mind. The constant corruption of others and getting past that. Our bodies should also be our own as much as our minds are. We unknowingly let the things that people say are beautiful or right become what we call beautiful and right. And it is endless until we realise that it doesn’t matter. Because our true owners and conductors are ourselves, but not enough people understand that. And with my Spirit piece, I wanted to share who I am and the reasons behind the things I do. Why I protect people, why I always seem so calm and collected. I share that I have a mask in this piece. And it would be wrong to think that everyone else doesn’t have a mask as well. Aside from not acknowledging reality, we as people-no as human beings alone, tend to always have parts of ourselves hidden from others. But that’s another influence controlled by everyone else. Someone at sometime made you realise the part you have hidden was not safe/good for other people to see. And it is okay to have parts of you hidden, but we cannot fail to understand that we do that just because of other people. Overall I truly just wanted to bring the reality of myself out. And hopefully bring others to a realization of their own corruptions and things that have been controlled about their own lives. I hope that in describing myself, others can see who they really are and what things are real to them. Because that is who I truly am. I am someone that wants everyone to live as themselves without being influenced to be someone they aren’t. To express myself to the fullest, I would like everyone around me to be as well-so I am not alone and neither are they. To just be who we are together.</p>
