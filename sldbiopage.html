I am Sydney DeFelix! I have been an artist since I was about 11, switching up between drawing, painting, airbrushing, and digital arts. I was born April 26th, in Richmond, Virginia. And I am currently a Sophmore at UWF. Some other things I get myself into are tattoo commissions, Twitch overlay commissions, and being a Twitch streamer myself!<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blackmamba76520"> Visit my channel @Twitch.tv </a></p>

Which is mainly organizing and designing all of the technical sides of a show. Props, set, lights, sounds, and costuming, while directing the leaders of those teams to finish all needed work before show day! It was always a lot of fun to do! ;)
